Mini challenge #3

Our pages app has grown in size and in purpose.
We should separate "pages" logic from "posts" logic so that
the code doesn't become unmaintainable.

1. Create a dedicated "posts" app.
2. Install it.
3. Move the "posts" views to this new app.
4. Move the urlpatterns that relate to posts to this new app.
5. Move the posts model to this new app.
